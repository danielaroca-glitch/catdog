# Design Directions Renderer

Subagent prompt. Produce 3 to 6 distinct visual directions for the product's hero screen, each as a standalone, self-contained HTML file at `.working/direction-{slug}.html` (or a single combined `directions-{n}.html` if the parent agent's intent calls for a side-by-side display).

Each direction represents a *complete visual personality* applied to the same key screen — not just a palette swap. Differentiate by density, typographic weight, motion implication, and brand register. Each file should contain: a 2-to-3-sentence rationale, a hero-screen mock at a near-1:1 ratio inside a phone or browser frame, ideally a secondary screen, and at least one visible state variant (aging row, empty state, etc.).

Use real product content present in the conversation. Voice and tone extracted from `.decision-log.md` applied to all visible strings — no lorem. Inline CSS, system fonts, no JS or network. Document the hex values in `<style>` comments per direction.

Keep all user-facing strings in PT-BR (Makuco artifact convention). Return to the parent agent: file paths, a one-line summary of each direction's personality, and which hero screen was represented. Do not dump HTML into the parent context. If interactive, open each file in the browser.
